<p> Safety here at YoungMMA is a top priority at all times. Kids must always have a mouthguard and protective gear at all times. Our staff are very tough on making sure all kids
are wearing the neccessary protective gear. Boxing gloves and shin guards can be provided.<p>

<p> When our coaching staff and the head coach feel that a child is ready to spar, extra precautions are taken. There is a staff member no more than 3 feet away at all times and protective gear must be worn. However, if you the parent do not feel comfortable with your child sparring we understand completely.<p>

<p> Jiu-jitsu is also practiced here at YoungMMA. Jiu-Jitsu is the art of submissions. An opponent can "tap out" when the person feels that they cannot get free or they feel too much pain. It is STRICTLY enforced here at YoungMMA that when a person taps out the opponent must let go immediately. <p>
