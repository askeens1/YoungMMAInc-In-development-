<article>What is MMA?
</article>
<p>Mixed Martial Arts is a full-contact combat sport that allows both striking and grappling, both standing and on the ground, using techniques from other combat sports and martial arts. <p>
<p>A common misconception is that MMA has no rules, when in fact, it has many. The Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts is the most common rule set used throughout the world. All state athletic commissions in the United States adopt the Unified Rules to help regulate the sport.

The rules are thorough and include the size of the fighting area, specifications about hand wrapping and information on judging and fouls, amongst many other things. They are an essential read for those wanting to understand the sport.
