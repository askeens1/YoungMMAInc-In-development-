<article>Our Mission
</article>

<p>Our mission here at YoungMMAinc. is to positively affect as many kids that we can reach out to by teaching them the sport of martial arts. There are too many kids without
role models in their lives and we here at YoungMMA want to change that.<p>

<headingArticle> Dicipline </headingArticle>

<p> While we want to help kids stay out of trouble, we also make it our mission to instill dicipline and resepect in their hearts. Even if a child does not wish to 
pursue martial arts after their time here, the morales that we teach will stay with them the rest of their lives. <P>

<p> We here at YoungMMA are very passionate about martial arts. We strongly believe that mixed martial arts is a priveledge and is an honor to be able to learn. Our coach, 
Alex Skeens has been practicing mixed martial arts for years and is very knowledgable in the sport. We take training very seriously and we intend to get your child in shape! In the United
States there are record statistics of overweight kids and we here at YoungMMA are making it our mission to change that! Below is a table representing that statistic<p>
